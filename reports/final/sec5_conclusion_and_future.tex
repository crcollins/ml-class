\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}


We have constructed 1500 polymeric systems and calculated their chemical properties, LUMO, HOMO and band gap, with three different methods. Altogether, there are 12 sets of data or 12000 data points. Based on polymer backbone building blocks and R groups, we have developed 11 different types of feature vectors including a null feature for comparison. Our first goals and milestones are accomplished by effectively implementing machine learning methods on these data sets and producing errors as low as 0.074 eV, 0.076 eV, 0.093 eV for HOMO, LUMO and band gap respectively.

We also achieve our minimum goal by dropping errors down to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol (0.047 eV)) through neural networks.

In the future, we should optimize our neural network testing methods to select the best hyperparameters, including layers and nodes. It's necessary to devise corresponding parallelization of codes to fulfill the testing requirements. We should also include more atom types and generalize our methods to nonpolymeric systems.
